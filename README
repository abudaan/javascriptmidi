DEPRECATED VERSION!

Please check: https://github.com/abudaan/midibridge-js


This is a port of the midibridge to a Javascript only version.

The code is still being developed. 

I have chosen the sandbox pattern which is set up in main.js, in main.js an instance of SampleApp is created and its callback function provides a namespace where you can start coding your own app.

There is very simple version of a regular keyboard included in the code, in the midi inputs dropdown menu you'll find the option "Regular Computer Keyboard". If you choose this option, you can play notes C4 - C5 with the keys A,S,D,F,G,H,J and K.

More documentation will follow soon (i hope) but meanwhile don't hesitate to contact me for questions at abudaan[at]gmail[dot]com 

IMPORTANT NOTE: this version is not yet compatible with the Actionscript version!! This means that you have to use the Applet that is provided in this repository. The Javascript version will *not* work with the Applet of the Actionscript version!
